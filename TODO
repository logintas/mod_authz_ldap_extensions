* Code review of the patches concerning security

  These patches have been developed with security in main focus.
  Still, the authors are not real experts in developing Apache
  security modules. Therefore, we recommend to do a code review before
  using these patches.

  Hereby, the authors (Logintas AG) explicitly emphasize that there is
  no warranty for these patches, neither by Logintas AG nor by the
  author of the original module.

  To do a code review, we recommend the following knowledge:
  - Apache webserver
  - Developing modules for the Apache webserver
  - LDAP
  - OpenSSL
